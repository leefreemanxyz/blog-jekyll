I"È<p>So, here I am, roughly six months after moving to Amsterdam and itâ€™s time for a change. I always tell people that I fell into editorial work by accident, and itâ€™s true.</p>

<p>A three month temp job at the OU as a production assistant straight after university turned into a full year of it. The company then hired a load of people, and Iâ€™d thrown my name in the hat for a new position as a copy editor. OneÂ proofreading test and interview later, and I had the job. Six months later, an opportunity came up and I threw my name in the hat again and, yep, you guessed it, I got the job. I didnâ€™t finish my Music Tech degree with the intention of editing online courses, it just kind of happened.</p>
