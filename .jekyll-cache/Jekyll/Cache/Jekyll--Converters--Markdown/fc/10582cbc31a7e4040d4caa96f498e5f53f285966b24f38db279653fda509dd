I"“<p>Well, itâ€™s two weeks since my last post and Iâ€™m now halfway through Codaisseurâ€™s two-month web developer academy. I. Am. Ex. Haus. Ted. Admittedly, Iâ€™m not making it easy for myself â€“ in the week before lastÂ I went to developer meetups on Tuesday and Wednesday, and had scheduled two for the last week (though I ended up sacking off the AmsterdamJS one on ThursdayÂ  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ ).</p>
