I"<p>React’s new Context API was finally made available with React 16.3 two weeks ago, and I was working on a client’s multilingual site that was passing the locale information through the props of every component. The context API seemed like a fairly decent way of avoiding having to pass the props like this, so this is my super quick implementation of how to do just that.</p>
