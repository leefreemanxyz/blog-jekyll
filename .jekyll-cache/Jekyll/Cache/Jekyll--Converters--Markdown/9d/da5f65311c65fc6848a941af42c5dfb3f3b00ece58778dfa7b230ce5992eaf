I"%<p>Itâ€™s been too long since my last post, but I think the one year anniversary of moving into this flat in Amsterdam is as good as any other to write something.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Things have really changed since last year â€“ bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I genuinely though I could make a go of being a freelance editor, despite the fact that I had no real passion for editorial work nor any network to draw on in Amsterdam, so I was relying on my old employer for scraps. It was pretty miserable, and Iâ€™ve written previously about how lame it was and my subsequent experiences at Codaisseur.</p>

<p>But what have I done since finishing at Codaisseur? Well, at my demo night I met a company who invited me to come check out their office, one thing led to another and I had a job offer (which has since turned into a permanent contract!).</p>

<p>Aside from working, Iâ€™ve continued with my Codaisseurify project that Iâ€™ve discussed previously. I refactored the back-end to use the RSpotify gem instead of making API calls in my node script â€“ this keeps my API keys secret, and lets me check if Iâ€™ve already requested the information I need for the song, so there should be less calls made to Spotifyâ€™s API. I also implemented a GraphQL endpoint with batch loaders to get avoid N+1 problems.</p>

<p>I then created a React app to fetch and display data (thanks, Apollo) from the back-end using the Recharts library. It needs a lot more design work, but you can <a href="https://music-visualizr.leefreeman.xyz/">check out</a> what I have so far. In the future Iâ€™d like to add sign-ups to it, so Iâ€™ve got to figure out the best way to either get them running the node script on their machines or find a different solution.</p>

<p>There are a few other little projects knocking around, but I doubt Iâ€™ll share much about them until I have something that is at least deployable.</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>

<p>The first year in Amsterdam was basically really tough in the first half of it and then really great in the second half, so what will the second year bring?</p>

<ul>
  <li>the freelance stuff will find some closure when I get the final accounts dealt with and can completely wash my hands of the whole thing</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ll finish my application for Irish citizenship and take a trip to Den Haag to get it processed (though Iâ€™ve heard it can take another 6 months after that to get it confirmed)</li>
  <li>a lot more gigs than last year. Iâ€™ve currently got LCD Soundsystem (twice), Portugal the Man and Father John Misty lined up. Iâ€™d quite like to get tickets for QOTSA, but â‚¬60 is a bit much (Iâ€™ve seen them before though, so Iâ€™m not going to lose sleep over not seeing them)</li>
  <li>once my ankle is better, Iâ€™ll get back to running in the mornings and make sure that I never run for a tram in my Stan Smiths ever again</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of coding, Iâ€™ve got a few things I want to learn/do in the next year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React Native â€“ Iâ€™ve dabbled with it, but would really like to build a â€˜realâ€™ app</li>
  <li>Python â€“ I did a bit of Python at Codaisseur for my â€˜Real World Projectâ€™, so Iâ€™d like to learn to use it properly as I think itâ€™s really flexible (Iâ€™ll focus on scraping/spiders, the Django framework and, if I have time, data analysis)</li>
  <li>Laravel â€“ PHP has a reputation for being really shitty, but Iâ€™d like to build a small CRUD app using Laravel (which is a Rails-like MVC framework)</li>
  <li>Kubernetes</li>
  <li>SuperCollider - I did so much with MaxMSP while at uni, that it seems a shame to not have any music-related projects. With my newly-acquired coding skills, I might finally attempt to tackle SuperCollider again!</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, I have a lot to work on, but Iâ€™ll try and update this a little more regularly as well!</p>
