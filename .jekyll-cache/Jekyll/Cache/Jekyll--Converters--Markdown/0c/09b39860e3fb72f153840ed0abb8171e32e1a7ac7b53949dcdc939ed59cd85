I"²<p>So my first week of <a href="https://www.codaisseur.com/">Codaisseurâ€™s academy/bootcamp</a> was a great success! I think the time spent on the <a href="http://learn.co/">Learn.co Bootcamp Prep</a>Â has really paid off and Iâ€™d definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about a bootcamp or about to embark on one.</p>

<p>The week started last Sunday and ran through until Friday evening. After a lovely day in Utrecht on the Saturday followed byÂ taking it very easy at a friendâ€™s birthday party on the Saturday evening, bright-eyed and bushy tailed, I turned up at the TQ building for 9.30am.</p>

<p>After a brief induction session (donâ€™t be a dick, treat the building/people with respect), we were straight into HTML and CSS with Tijn. Now, Iâ€™ve got a fair amount of experience with HTML and CSS, so I was a bit concerned about what I would get out of the day, but luckily there was some interesting stuff to get stuck into.</p>
