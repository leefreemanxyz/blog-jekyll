I"®<p>I graduated from the Codaisseur Academy program in April 2017. I wrote a few blog posts about my experience and new/prospective students regularly contact me asking for insights/advice etc. Hopefully this post can answer some of the more common questions, but the TLDR is that I did this course over 2 years ago, a lot has changed at Codaisseur and youâ€™re better off finding a more recent graduate to ask.</p>

My first employer post-Codaisseur attended my graduation/demo night and approached me after my presentation. We went for lunch, I met the team and was made an offer.
