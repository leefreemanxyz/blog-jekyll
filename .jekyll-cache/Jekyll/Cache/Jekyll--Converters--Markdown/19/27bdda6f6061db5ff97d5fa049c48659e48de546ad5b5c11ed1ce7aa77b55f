I"Z<p>That’s Week 2 of Codaisseur completed and I’m now 25% of the way through the course. We were only in class for 5 days this week, but the extra day was spent doing homework, so…¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>My last post was about 1400 words, but I think I actually did more this week than last week, so…¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  Some people would suggest editing these things after writing them, but I’m pretty sure that as a career-switcher from editorial I can refuse to ever edit anything ever again (edit: spotted a typo in this paragraph immediately after publishing, so here I am fixing it).</p>
