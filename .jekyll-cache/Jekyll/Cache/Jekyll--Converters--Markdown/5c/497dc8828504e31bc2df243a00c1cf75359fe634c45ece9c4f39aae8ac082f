I"ý<p>So, the whole blogging all the way through the course thing didnâ€™t really work out. Things really kicked up a notch once we moved into the advanced bootcamp, and I didnâ€™t really have time for coding and writing. Sorry about that!</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t read any further than this, Iâ€™m currently looking for a job to put these new skills to good use. <a href="https://github.com/leefreemanxyz">Hereâ€™s my GitHub</a>, Iâ€™m really interested in React-y/ES6-y roles, so show me what youâ€™ve got.</p>
